This is a website created to introduce what happened to Jeanne Mance (one of the resident halls in UVM) 
and help find where other previous Jeanne Mance residents are living now.
We originally planned to make an additional page that displays each person in each residence hall, but have failed due to lack of time.
But the main page still manages to show the general idea of this website.
